Overview:
The purpose of this project is to put everything previously learned in VBA into a single project. With this we will also compare the original run to the new version to see which is faster and what new information can be learned.



Results:
The original versions of the VBA analysis were faster than the newer one. For the years 2017 and 2018, the original was timed at 0.068 seconds while the newer version was timed at 0.09 seconds [see images in Resource folder]. This shows that either the method of going through the rows was faster on the original or I wrote the code incorrectly. The output for the new version is also not the same as the example so I did mess up somewhere in the code.
